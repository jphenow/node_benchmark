# YABP or Yet Another Benchmark Project

This is another benchmark project setup to test:

* Node.js
* Ruby EventMachine
* Twisted Python
* PHP/Apache (I know hardly comparable in this group, pure interest)

## You need

* Ruby 1.9.2+
* Python 2.7 and Twisted
* Node.js v0.6.7+
* PHP 5.3.8
* Apache

## There'll be no hand-holding here

Sorry I just don't have the time to setup a dependcy check on this all, especially
since I've already got all of these set up on my Mac and Linux Mint computers. On
any *nix computer their setups should be pretty straight-forward.

Be sure to run a `bundle install` in the top directory to get Ruby dependencies.
